# Digital Certificate Verification

A blockchain-based digital certificate verification system built with Solidity smart contracts and deployed on Core Testnet 2.

## Project Description

The Digital Certificate Verification project provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system for issuing and verifying digital certificates. Built on blockchain technology, this solution ensures that certificates cannot be forged or altered while providing instant verification capabilities for employers, institutions, and other stakeholders.

The system utilizes smart contracts to manage certificate issuance, verification, and revocation, creating an immutable record of all educational and professional achievements. Each certificate is cryptographically secured and linked to its issuer, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the way educational and professional credentials are issued, stored, and verified. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

- **Eliminate Certificate Fraud**: Create tamper-proof digital certificates that cannot be forged or altered
- **Streamline Verification**: Provide instant, automated verification for employers and institutions
- **Empower Individuals**: Give certificate holders complete control over their credentials
- **Reduce Costs**: Minimize administrative overhead for educational institutions and employers
- **Global Accessibility**: Enable worldwide verification of credentials without geographical barriers
- **Trust & Transparency**: Build a transparent system where all stakeholders can verify credentials independently

## Key Features

  "Tech University",
  "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
);
```

### Verifying a Certificate
```javascript
const verification = await project.verifyCertificate(certificateId);
console.log("Valid:", verification[0]);
console.log("Recipient:", verification[1]);
console.log("Course:", verification[2]);
```

### Revoking a Certificate
```javascript
await project.revokeCertificate(certificateId);
```
